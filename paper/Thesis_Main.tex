\section*{Abstract}


In the rapidly growing market of car-sharing mobility, operational decision-making
can determine success or failure for car-sharing organizations. Predicting the impact
of these decisions analytically is a complex and high dimensional problem. Further complexity
comes from the heterogeneity of the vehicle fleet a customer is offered.
This paper proposes
a discrete event simulation that aims to provide quantitative metrics,
indicating the performance of the car-sharing networks and therefore providing a computationally
efficient way to analyze to effect of operational decisions. The simulation environment models a non-floating
one-way car-sharing system, equipped with a vehicle choice classifier that
is trained using existing car-sharing rental data. The classifier receives as input
a customer request, that is defined by socio-demographic factors as well as the travel route that is planned.
The proposed framework is then implemented for a specific car-sharing deployment in Berlin, Germany.
The dynamics of the model, in terms of the presented metrics,
are then analyzed in regard to the fleet size as well as the Substitution Effect, that
captures the choice uncertainty when selecting a specific vehicle type
that is typically present in real-world
decision-making.
