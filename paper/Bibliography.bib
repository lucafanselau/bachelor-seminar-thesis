  abstract = {In this paper, we perform a systematic review of selected publications that offer method-based solutions to the vehicle relocation issues in car sharing networks. Asymmetric networks allowing one-way trips are the most promising form of car-sharing systems. However, the resulting vehicle imbalance across the station grid requires relocations. Typical approaches to solving the vehicle relocation problem include mixed-integer programming for strategic or operation-oriented design problems, as well as simulation models for management tasks. We survey how researchers define the decision problems related to the vehicle relocation issue, and consider their division into multistage approaches. This article offers a starting point for researchers interested in modeling one-way vehicle sharing.}

  abstract = {The growth of car-sharing services as a new and more sustainable way of transportation is shifting the private mobility from ownership to service use. Despite the emerging importance of this type of mobility and the large number of papers present in the scientific literature, to the best of our knowledge no extensive and structured analysis has been performed to classify the research and determine the mainstreams. Aim of this study is to introduce a taxonomy and analyze the different aspects of car-sharing, including the different car-sharing services and the research questions considered in the papers. We analyze and classify 137 papers, covering the last fifteen years of research and deriving an insight of the mainstreams. Finally, we deeply study the trends and research perspectives of the literature, showing the unbalancing between the literature related to the operational level and the economic, business development and customer validation aspects.}

  abstract = {Facing the growing demand for carsharing services, it is critical for operators to accurately predict users’ preferences on different vehicle types and their vehicle usage. This vehicle choice behavior involves choosing multiple vehicle types simultaneously and allocating continuous amounts of budget to the chosen vehicles. The recent developed multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) modeling framework provides a suitable platform for allocation of continuous amounts of a consumer good (expenditure) to different discrete outcomes (different vehicle types). In this study, we develop three MDCEV models considering travel time, mileage, and monetary expenditure as the continuous consumption constraints. The three models estimate the impacts of a set of socio-demographic attributes on user’s vehicle choice and capture the satiation effect with increasing the consumption for each vehicle type. The study also employs an efficient simulation procedure to obtain the simulated results of the three models, and compare the results to the observed data using normalized RMSE and correct ratio to determine the best-fitted model. The estimation results suggest that user age, income level, driving license country, insurance plan, membership plan, and origin location have impacts on users’ vehicle utilization patterns. The comparison results indicate that travel time, mileage and expenditure affect users’ vehicle utilization patterns in the same way, and all three models can provide accurate predictions for the vehicle choice behavior. These findings can be referred to by operators when determining the most efficient allocation of resources within carsharing systems.}
