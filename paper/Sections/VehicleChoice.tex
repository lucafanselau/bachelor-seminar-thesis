Mathematical description of vehicle choice model

% Maybe a model that calculates if a vehicle will be rented

\subsection{Data source}
\label{sub_sec:DataSource}

- Dataset 4gb
- Zensus data


\subsection{Data preparation}
\label{sub_sec:DataPreparation}

- Huge bias towards smart fortwo
- Missing income
- SMOTE for oversampling (the models (eg. labels) that were underrepresented)
- Maybe: model -> class mapping (we are primarily interested in the class)


% TODO: Will be replaced by a district concept
Features:

We propose a person, which is defined by a feature vector. From now on a person strictly refers to a specific realization 
of these features unless mentioned otherwise. 

\begin{longtable}{l | c}
  \caption{Features}
  \label{table:features}
  \\
  \textbf{Label} & \textbf{Description} \\
  \hline
  age & The current age of this person, must be > 18 years. unbounded otherwise \\
  hss & Household size\\
  college & 1 (or true) if the person had college education, 0 (or false) otherwise \\
  income & Monthly income, before taxes \\
  comm & Commuting distance (daily)
\end{longtable}

% ENDTODO

\subsection{Classifier model}
\label{sub_sec:Classifier}

- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

Estimates the Probability of $P(y | x)$ where $y \in \mathbb{C}$ and $x$ is a valid socio-demographic
description % TODO: Add the reference to the data definition of the socio demographic description



\subsection{Results}
\label{sub_sec:ClassifierResults}

% TODO: Accuracy scores (in the face of the )


% NOTE: Was a good idea, but will not be useful for the new thing
% Scoring algorithm with the following "decisions":

% Early opt out case: $age < 21$: Typically only the XS category is allowed to be driven by persons under the age of 21.
% Otherwise we will employ a scoring algorithm which, where we calculate a score $s(o)$ where 
% $o \in \{ \textrm{XS}, \textrm{S}, \textrm{M}, \textrm{L} \} = C$. The score is based on various sub-scores, namely:
% $$
% s_0(o) = 
% \begin{cases}
%   1 - P(\text{hss} > 2 \land \text{category} = o), & \text{if}\ \text{hss}\ \le 2 \\
%   P(\text{hss} > 2 \land \text{category} = o), & \text{otherwise}
% \end{cases}
% $$
% where $P(\text{hss} > 2 \land \text{category} = o) \ \forall o \in C$ is determined empirically by using the data source 
% mentioned in \ref{sub_sec:DataSource} and can be found in the Appendix\todo{Add that to the Appendix}. Another important 
% scoring mechanism depictures a correlation between commuting distance and the size an can be similarily described as:
% $$
% s_1(o) = 
% \begin{cases}
%   1 - P(\text{comm} > 2 \land \text{category} = o), & \text{if}\ \text{hss}\ \le 2 \\
%   P(\text{comm} > 2 \land \text{category} = o), & \text{otherwise}
% \end{cases}
% $$
