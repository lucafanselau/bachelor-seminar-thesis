## Requirements

- Model mobility behavior of _on-demand_ vehicle platforms
- Model vehicle choice based on existing vehicle rental data

  - Eg. which target audience chooses which vehicle
  - Hard requirements (eg. age)
  - Distance optimization

- Substition effects?
- OpenAI world?

# Research circle(?)

## Practical problem

On demand car sharing platforms are risking a loss of sales, if customers are dissatisfied by the vehicle choice, in the area.

## Research question

Can we implement a vehicle choice model, that maximises network revenue?

## Research problem

1. Testing the feasibility of that model, is hard, since a real world implementation is costly!
2. What metrics do we use as an indicator of success.

Relevancy:

If we solve the feasibility testing, we have a low cost solution to testing various model solutions, pre-implementation

## Research answer / Research objective

Developing a model for a vehicle choice, based on real world data and developing a

We test the feasibility of the model solutions using a discrete-event simulation. If designed well enough the simulation can capture real world network effects and gives a quick indicator of the quality of the model solution.
